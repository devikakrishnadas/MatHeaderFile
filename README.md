# MatHeaderFile

This repo has a simple implementation of a C++ headerfile.
This headerfile deals with matrices and provides extremely basic operations.

It also consists of a test program that takes a size, say n, as an input an does all the basic operations for all sizes b/w 1 to n and reports the time taken by the program to execute them.
